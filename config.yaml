  fsid:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The unique identifier (fsid) of the Ceph cluster.
      .
      WARNING: this option should only be used when performing an in-place
      migration of an existing non-charm deployed Ceph cluster to a charm
      managed deployment.
  config-flags:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      User provided Ceph configuration. Supports a string representation of
      a python dictionary where each top-level key represents a section in
      the ceph.conf template. You may only use sections supported in the
      template.
      .
      WARNING: this is not the recommended way to configure the underlying
      services that this charm installs and is used at the user's own risk.
      This option is mainly provided as a stop-gap for users that either
      want to test the effect of modifying some config or who have found
      a critical bug in the way the charm has configured their services
      and need it fixed immediately. We ask that whenever this is used,
      that the user consider opening a bug on this charm at
      http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms providing an explanation of why the
      config was needed so that we may consider it for inclusion as a
      natively supported config in the charm.
  auth-supported:
    type: string
    default: cephx
    description: |
      [DEPRECATED] Which authentication flavour to use.
      .
      This option no longer has any effect. It's insecure and breaks expected
      Ceph functionality when assigned to None. The charm now ignores the
      option and always sets auth to cephx.
      .
      Original description:
      .
      [DEPRECATED] Valid options are "cephx" and "none". If "none" is
      specified, keys will still be created and deployed so that it can be
      enabled later.
  monitor-secret:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The Ceph secret key used by Ceph monitors. This value will become the
      mon.key. To generate a suitable value use:
      .
        ceph-authtool /dev/stdout --name=mon. --gen-key
      .
      If left empty, a secret key will be generated.
      .
      NOTE: Changing this configuration after deployment is not supported and
      new service units will not be able to join the cluster.
  monitor-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Number of ceph-mon units to wait for before attempting to bootstrap the
      monitor cluster. For production clusters the default value of 3 ceph-mon
      units is normally a good choice.
      .
      For test and development environments you can enable single-unit
      deployment by setting this to 1.
      .
      NOTE: To establish quorum and enable partition tolerance a odd number of
      ceph-mon units is required.
  monitor-hosts:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      A space-separated list of ceph mon hosts to use. This field is only used
      to migrate an existing cluster to a juju-managed solution and should

    default: 30
    description: |
      Raise HEALTH_WARN status when the filesystem that houses a monitor's data
      store reports that its available capacity is less than or equal to this
      percentage.
  monitor-data-available-critical:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Raise HEALTH_ERR status when the filesystem that houses a monitor's data
      store reports that its available capacity is less than or equal to this
      percentage.
  expected-osd-count:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      The number of OSDs expected to be deployed in the cluster. This value can
      influence the number of placement groups (PGs) to use for pools. The PG
      calculation is based either on the actual number of OSDs or this option's
      value, whichever is greater. The default value is '0', which tells the
      charm to only consider the actual number of OSDs. If the actual number of
      OSDs is less than three then this option must explicitly state that
      number.
  pgs-per-osd:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      The number of placement groups per OSD to target. It is important to
      properly size the number of placement groups per OSD as too many
      or too few placement groups per OSD may cause resource constraints and
      performance degradation. This value comes from the recommendation of
      the Ceph placement group calculator (http://ceph.com/pgcalc/) and
      recommended values are:
      .
      100 - If the cluster OSD count is not expected to increase in the
            foreseeable future.
      200 - If the cluster OSD count is expected to increase (up to 2x) in the
            foreseeable future.
      300 - If the cluster OSD count is expected to increase between 2x and 3x
            in the foreseeable future.
  ceph-public-network:
    type: string

      The IP address and netmask of the public (front-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  ceph-cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the cluster (back-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default: '{ kernel.pid_max : 2097152, vm.max_map_count : 524288,
                kernel.threads-max: 2097152 }'
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently. By default we set pid_max, max_map_count and
      threads-max to a high value to avoid problems with large numbers (>20)
      of OSDs recovering. very large clusters should set those values even
      higher (e.g. max for kernel.pid_max is 4194303).
  customize-failure-domain:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Setting this to true will tell Ceph to replicate across Juju's
      Availability Zone instead of specifically by host.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the hostname
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
          juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups. If left empty, the
      nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup.

    type: string
    description: |
      Recovery rate (in objects/s) below which we consider recovery
      to be stalled.
  nagios_raise_nodeepscrub:
    default: True
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether to report Critical instead of Warning when the nodeep-scrub
      flag is set.
  nagios_check_num_osds:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether to report an error when number of known OSDs does not equal
      to the number of OSDs in or up.
  nagios_additional_checks:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
       Dictionary describing additional checks. Key is a name of a check
       which will be visible in Nagios. Value is a string (regular expression)
       which is checked against status messages.
       .
       Example:
       .
       {'noout_set': 'noout', 'too_few_PGs': 'too few PGs', 'clock': 'clock skew',
       'degraded_redundancy': 'Degraded data redundancy'}

      are positive.
  nagios_rgw_sites:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
       Comma-separated list of sites that are expected to be connected to this
       radosgw. These will be checked by the line "data sync source...
       (site-name)" in the output of `radosgw-admin sync status`.
       .
       Example:
       .
       site1,site2
  nagios_rgw_additional_checks:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
       List describing additional checks. Each item is a regular expression to
       search in the output of radosgw-admin sync status. Note, this is a
       list unlike `nagios_additional_checks` which uses a dictionary.
       .
       Example:
       .
       ['data is behind on']
       .
  use-direct-io:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: Configure use of direct IO for OSD journals.
  default-rbd-features:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Default RBD Features to use when creating new images.  The value of this
      configuration option will be shared with consumers of the ``ceph-client``
      interface and client charms may choose to add this to the Ceph
      configuration file on the units they manage.

      Example:

          rbd default features = 1

      NOTE: If you have clients using the kernel RBD driver you must set this
      configuration option to a value corrensponding to the features the driver
      in your kernel supports.  The kernel RBD driver tends to be multiple
      cycles behind the userspace driver available for libvirt/qemu.  Nova LXD
      is among the clients depending on the kernel RBD driver.

      NOTE: If you want to use the RBD Mirroring feature you must either let
      this configuration option be the default or make sure the value you set
      includes the ``exclusive-lock`` and ``journaling`` features.
  no-bootstrap:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Causes the charm to not do any of the initial bootstrapping of the
      Ceph monitor cluster. This is only intended to be used when migrating
      from the ceph all-in-one charm to a ceph-mon / ceph-osd deployment.
      Refer to the Charm Deployment guide at https://docs.openstack.org/charm-deployment-guide/latest/
      for more information.
  disable-pg-max-object-skew:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack clouds that use ceph will typically start their life with at
      least one pool (glance) loaded with a disproportionately high amount of
      data/objects where other pools may remain empty. This can trigger HEALTH_WARN
      if mon_pg_warn_max_object_skew is exceeded but that is actually false positive.
  pg-autotune:
    type: string
    default: auto
    description: |
      The default configuration for pg-autotune will be to automatically enable
      the module for new cluster installs on Ceph Nautilus, but to leave it
      disabled for all cluster upgrades to Nautilus. To enable the pg-autotune
      feature for upgraded clusters, the pg-autotune option should be set to
      'true'. To disable the autotuner for new clusters, the pg-autotune option
      should be set to 'false'.
  permit-insecure-cmr:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The charm does not segregate access to pools from different models properly,
      this means that the correct charm settings can result with client model B
      having access to the data from model A.
  balancer-mode:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The balancer mode used by the Ceph manager. Can only be set for Luminous or
      later versions, and only when the balancer module is enabled.
